# vim-joh-fifteen-theme

Dark, high contrast, warm colorscheme for 256 color terminal with support for
transparency.
Based on [harlequin](https://github.com/nielsmadan/harlequin) which is inspired
by [molokai](https://github.com/tomasr/molokai) and
[badwolf](https://github.com/sjl/badwolf).

You may want to use [harlequin](https://github.com/nielsmadan/harlequin)
instead since this fork will most likely not provide any improvements to
you.

## Properties

- Dark background, warm colors, high contrast, but nothing too garish.
- Everything that's constantly on screen and not code is low key.
- No color clashes, where very different colors are close to each other.
